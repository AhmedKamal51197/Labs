In Apache HTTP Server, the LogFormat directive is used to define the format of the log entries generated by the server. This directive allows you to customize the information that is recorded in the server's access logs. The general syntax for the LogFormat directive is as follows


LogFormat "%format_string%" nickname

Here, %format_string% is a string that represents the desired log format, and nickname is an optional identifier for the format. You can then refer to this nickname when specifying the log format for a particular virtual host or the main server configuration.

The format string is composed of various placeholders, each prefixed with a % character, which gets replaced with specific information about each request. Here are some commonly used placeholders:

%h: Remote host (the client's IP address)
%l: Remote logname (currently not implemented)
%u: Remote user (from authenticated user if any)
%t: Date and time of the request
%t can be followed by a format string in square brackets to specify the time format. For example, %t[%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z].
%r: First line of the request
%s: HTTP status code returned to the client
%b: Size of the response in bytes, excluding HTTP headers
%{Referer}i: Referer (the page that linked to this URL)
%{User-Agent}i: User agent (the browser or other client making the request)
